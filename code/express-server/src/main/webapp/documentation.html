            <h3>Install</h3>
            <p>
               Download the latest war file and deply it to your favourite servlet container. The latest build
               is tested on Tomcat 6.0.20 but there is no reason why it would have problems on any 2.4 compliant
               servlet container.
               Because of the way the flex aplication swf is compiled, you will need to deploy express to the root 
               of your domain. This means that if you are simply deploying to the localhost in the Tomcat webapps 
               directory you will need to unzip the application war and rename it ROOT.
            </p>
            <p>
               Express requires a relational database. By default it uses postgres and was developed against 8.4.
               It will work against most relational databases as persistence is done via JPA and database management
               through Liquibase. In order to use a different database, at this stage, you will need to add the 
               database driver to the lib directory and change the properties accordingly (see config section below).
            </p>
            <h3>Configure</h3>
            <p>
               Most configuration is done in the application.properties file which is located in the exploded war
               file under theWEB-INF/classes folder.
               At a minimum you will need to add the properties for your smtp server. Without an smtp server you cannot
               register as express sends a confirmation email to ensure that the user has a valid email address. You 
               will also need to change the entry for the applicationUrl to your domain name as the link in the c
               onfirmation email uses this.
            </p>
            <h3>Use</h3>
            <h4>Register</h4>
            <p>
               The fist thing you will need to do is register an user account. User registration can be reached from
               the link on the login page. An email, password, and password hint is all that is required but additional
               details such as the colour you want to see for your stories / tasks, your full name and contact phone
               can be added also to help others in your team(s) identify you.
            </p>
            <p>
                 After registering an email with a confirmation link will be sent to the email address provided. this link
                 will need to be used in order to activate the account. After this is done you can login.
            </p>
            <h4>Create a project</h4>
            <p>
               On your first login you will be directed to the project creation / access page. Here you can create a project
               or request to join an existing one. Your request will be emailed to the project manager(s) immediately but 
               you will not actually get acess to their project until they have acted on the request. If you create a new
               project it will be setup immediately and you can go to work on it straight away.
            </p>
            <p>
               When you create a project you automatically become it's manager. This means you recieve all requests to join
               the project and can approve or reject them.
            </p>
