      	<h4>What prerequisites are required to install Express ?</h4>
         <div>
            <p>
               Express comes as a Java war file. It can be deployed to any servlet container
               such as Tomcat or Jetty. You can download Tomcat <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi">here</a>.
               Express requires a relational database, and the current default database is Postgres. You can download
               the latest version <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/download/">here</a>. Configuration details can be
               found in the Express documentation page.
            </p>
         </div>
         <h4>What is the wall view ?</h4>
         <div>
            <p>
               Wall view provides a virtual project wall where Stories remain on the left and
               their Tasks can be dragged and dropped through swim lanes from OPEN to IN
               PROGRESS to TEST and finally CLOSED. The project team can quickly get and idea
               of what is being worked on and what remains to be worked on by checking the
               virtual project wall.
            </p>
         </div>
         <h4>
            I have created Stories and moved them into an Iteration, why cant I move them
            through the swim lanes ?
         </h4>
         <div>
            <p>
               In Scrum stories are static. They are broken down into Tasks which can then be
               progressed though the various development stages. You can create Tasks on the
               virtual wall by clicking the create icon on the top right of the Story or if
               you go the the backlog view you can create Tasks by clicking the add icon
               against that story in the datagrid. For developers who don't want to have
               multiple Tasks you simply create a single child Task for the Story to
               progress along the wall. When all Tasks are in test or closed, the story is
               progressed automatically to the same state. When any Task is in progress, the
               story is in progress.
            </p>
         </div>
         <h4>How do I edit a Story or Task ?</h4>
         <div>
            <p>
               In the backlog view double clicking on a Story or Task will open it in edit
               mode. The Window can be resized to whatever size is convenient and it will
               remember it's size so that al other Stries or Tasks are opened in the same
               sized window for that session.
            </p>
         </div>
         <h4>How do I move Stories into and out of an Iteration ?</h4>
         <div>
            <p>
               In the backlog view you can drag a story from the Product Backlog into the
               currently selected Iteration. You can select multiple Stories and drag them
               all at once or you can bring the Stories over one at a time. Generally
               Iteration managers will drag uncompleted stories back into the Product Backlog
               if the are not 100% complete at the end of an Iteration. Express remebers the
               progress of all the Stroy's Tasks and when the Story is dragged into a new
               Iteration they remain where they were at the end of the previous one.
            </p>
         </div>
         <h4>How do I start work on a Task ?</h4>
         <div>
            <p>
               In the wall view you just drag the Task card from OPEN into IN PROGRESS Express
               will popup a message box to ask you to assign the Task to someone and you will
               be selected by default. If you want to assign it to someone else then just
               select them from the list.
            </p>
         </div>
         <h4>What is a Burndown ?</h4>
         <div>
            <p>
               A burndown chart shows you at a glance how many hours are left to complete an
               Iteration. Over time the chart progresses toward zero as developers reduce
               the number of hours remaining on the Tasks they are working on. Often there
               are spikes in the burndown when the team reaslises tasks which they forgot
               when they did the initial estimation or they elicit new requirements or details
               from the product owner. We don't worry too much about this, we
               just keep tracking it, the shape of the burndown can tell a lot about how the
               team and product owner are working together.
