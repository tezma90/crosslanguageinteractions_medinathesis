org.apache.commons.configuration.PropertiesConfiguration

enables a java application to read configuration data from a variety of sources


org.springframework.orm.jpa.LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean

FactoryBean that creates a JPA EntityManagerFactory according to JPAâ€™s standard bootstrap contract, it can be shared in a Spring application context.
Settings are usually read from a .xml file in a default location, but it can be overridden. 
This EntityManagerFactory will implement all of the native underlying interfaces returned from the PersistenceProvider


org.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager

Binds a JPA EntityManager from the specified factory to the thread.
This is appropriate for applications that use a single JPA EntityManagerFactory for transactional data access.
This transaction mangare supports direct DataSource access within a transaction allowing for mixing services which access JPA and services which use plain JDBC


com.googlecode.simpleobjectassembler.SimpleObjectAssembler

A simple object assembler with the ability to register converters for mapping objects of different types.
Basica configuration for simple cases with the option to override and extend behaviour in different ways for more complex scenarios.
It is free of xml configuration opting for a runtime specification of property paths to ignore for a specific invocation and conversion logic written in Java.


org.springframework.cache.ehcache.EhCacheManagerFactoryBean

FactoryBean that exposes a EHCache CacheManager singleton, configured from a specified config location.
If no config location is specified, a CacheManager will be configured from "ehcache.xml" in the root of the class path.
EhCacheManagerFactoryBean is also necessary for loading EHCache configuration from a non-default config location.



org.springframework.cache.ehcache.EhCacheFactoryBean

FactoryBean that creates a named EHCache Cache object, representing a cache region.
If the specified named cache is not configured, this FactoryBean will construct an instance of a Cache and the specified cache properties and add it to the CacheManager for later retrieval.
If some or all properties are not set, this FactoryBean will use defaults.
If the named Cache instance is found, the properties will be ignored and the Cache instance will be retrieved from CacheManager.


org.springframework.security.providers.encoding.ShaPasswordEncoder

SHA implementation of PasswordEncoder.
If a null password is presented, it will be treated as an empty String ("") password.
As SHA is a one-way hash, the salt can contain any characters.


com.mchange.v2.c3p0.ComboPooledDataSource

c3p0 is an easy-to-use library for making traditional JDBC drivers "enterprise-ready".
By augmenting them with functionality defined by the jdbc3 spec and the optional extensions to jdbc2.
Classes which adapt traditional DriverManager-based JDBC drivers to the newer javax.sql.DataSource scheme for acquiring database Connections.
3p0 DataSources are both Referenceable and Serializable, and are thus suitable for binding to a wide-variety of JNDI-based naming services.


org.springframework.orm.jpa.vendor.HibernateJpaVendorAdapter

Exposes Hibernate's persistence provider and EntityManager extension interface, and supports AbstractJpaVendorAdapter's common configuration settings.


liquibase.spring.SpringMigrator	LIB	UNSOURCABLE




org.springframework.ui.velocity.VelocityEngineFactoryBean

Factory bean that configures a VelocityEngine and provides it as bean reference. 
This bean is intended for any kind of usage of Velocity in application code.
